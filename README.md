**Mini Project: Social Network Simulation in Java**

**Overview**

This Java-based project simulates a basic social networking platform, focusing on user interactions such as:

      1.Creating and liking posts
      2.Tagging posts
      3.Viewing posts sorted by popularity


It demonstrates key Java concepts such as:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

     1.Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)
     2.Custom Comparators
     3.Static variables for unique identifiers
     4.User input handling via Scanner

**Features**

        1.Post Creation: Users can create text-based posts with optional tags.
        2.Like System: Posts can be liked by users, and the number of likes is tracked.
        3.Tagging: Posts can be tagged to indicate category or topic.
        4.Sorting: Posts are sorted by like count using a custom comparator.
        5.User Model: Represents students who interact with the system by creating or liking posts.


**Technology**

      Java: Programming language used to build the project.
      Java Collections: Used for data storage and logic, such as managing lists of posts and users.
      LocalDateTime: Utilized to track timestamps related to posts and interactions.
